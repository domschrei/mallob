# Introduction

Mallob is a platform for massively parallel and distributed on-demand processing of malleable jobs, handling their scheduling and load balancing.
Malleability means that the CPU resources allotted to a job may vary _during its execution_ depending on the system's overall load.
Mallob was tested on configurations with up to 6144 cores as described in our publications: [SAT 2021](https://dominikschreiber.de/papers/2021-sat-scalable.pdf), [Euro-Par 2022](https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000149349/149124221).

Most notably, Mallob features an engine for distributed SAT solving.
According to the [International SAT Competitions](https://satcompetition.github.io/) 2020-2023, the premier competitive events for state-of-the-art SAT solving, Mallob is consistently the strongest SAT solving system for massively parallel and distributed systems (1600 hardware threads spread across 100 machines) and also a highly competitive system for moderately parallel SAT solving (64 hardware threads).
Note that this version of Mallob also features a module to generate proofs of unsatisfiability due to a cooperation with external researchers from Amazon Web Services (see [docs/certified-unsat.md](docs/certified-unsat.md)).

Furthermore, Mallob features an engine for K-Means clustering, authored by [Michael Dörr](https://github.com/MichaelDoerr) in the scope of his Bachelor thesis.

# Setup

## Prerequisites

Note that we only support Linux as an operating system.
(Some people have been developing and experimenting with Mallob within the WSL, but there seem to be issues related to inotify.)

* CMake ≥ 3.11.4
* Open MPI (or another MPI implementation)
* GDB
* [jemalloc](https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc)

## Building

```
# This call is only necessary if building with MALLOB_APP_SAT (enabled by default).
# For non-x86-64 architectures (ARM, POWER9, etc.), prepend `DISABLE_FPU=1` to "bash".
( cd lib && bash fetch_and_build_sat_solvers.sh )
mkdir -p build
cd build
CC=$(which mpicc) CXX=$(which mpicxx) cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -DMALLOB_APP_SAT=1 -DMALLOB_USE_JEMALLOC=1 -DMALLOB_LOG_VERBOSITY=4 -DMALLOB_ASSERT=1 -DMALLOB_SUBPROC_DISPATCH_PATH=\"build/\" ..
make; cd ..
```

Specify `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE` for a release build or `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG` for a debug build.
You can use the following Mallob-specific build options:

| Usage                                       | Description                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| -DMALLOB_ASSERT=<0/1>                       | Turn on assertions (even on release builds). Setting to 0 limits assertions to debug builds.               |
| -DMALLOB_JEMALLOC_DIR=path                  | If necessary, provide a path to a local installation of `jemalloc` where `libjemalloc.*` is located.       |
| -DMALLOB_LOG_VERBOSITY=<0..6>               | Only compile logging messages of the provided maximum verbosity and discard more verbose log calls.        |
| -DMALLOB_SUBPROC_DISPATCH_PATH=\\"path\\"   | Subprocess executables must be located under <path> for Mallob to find. (Use `\"build/\"` by default.)     |
| -DMALLOB_USE_ASAN=<0/1>                     | Compile with Address Sanitizer for debugging purposes.                                                     |
| -DMALLOB_USE_GLUCOSE=<0/1>                  | Compile with support for Glucose SAT solver (disabled by default due to licensing issues, see below).      |
| -DMALLOB_USE_JEMALLOC=<0/1>                 | Compile with Scalable Memory Allocator `jemalloc` instead of default `malloc`.                             |
| -DMALLOB_APP_KMEANS=<0/1>                   | Compile with K-Means clustering engine.                                                                    |
| -DMALLOB_APP_SAT=<0/1>                      | Compile with SAT solving engine.                                                                           |
| -DMALLOB_MAX_N_APPTHREADS_PER_PROCESS=<0/1> | Max. number of application threads (solver threads for SAT) per process to support. (max: 128)             |

## Docker

We also provide a Dockerfile using an Ubuntu 20.04 setup.

```
cd docker/leader
docker build -t mallob:leader ../.. -f ./Dockerfile
```

## Bash Autocompletion

Mallob features bash auto-completion by pressing TAB. To enable this, execute this command from Mallob's base directory:

  source scripts/run/autocomplete.sh

From this directory you can now autocomplete program options by pressing TAB once or twice.

<hr/>

# Testing

**Note:** In its current state, the test suite expects that Mallob is built and run with OpenMPI, i.e., that `mpicc` and `mpicxx` (for building) and `mpirun` (for execution) link to OpenMPI executables on your system. For other MPI implementations, you may still be able to run the tests by removing or replacing the option `--oversubscribe` from the function `run()` in `scripts/run/systest_commons.sh`.

In order to test that the system has been built and set up correctly, run the following command.
```
bash scripts/run/systest.sh mono drysched sched osc
```
This will locally run a suite of automated tests which cover the basic functionality of Mallob as a scheduler and as a SAT solving engine. 
To include Glucose in the tests, prepend the above command with "GLUCOSE=1".
Running the tests takes a few minutes and in the end "All tests done." should be output.

QBF: mpirun -np 4 build/mallob -c=-1 -v=4 -mono-app=QBF -mono-subjobs=1 -mono=instances/qbf/r3unsat_300.qdimacs

<hr/>

# Usage

## General

Given a single machine with two hardware threads per core, the following command executed in Mallob's base directory assigns one MPI process to each set of four physical cores (eight hardware threads) and then runs four solver threads on each MPI process.

```
RDMAV_FORK_SAFE=1; NPROCS="$(($(nproc)/8))"; mpirun -np $NPROCS --bind-to core --map-by ppr:${NPROCS}:node:pe=4 build/mallob -t=4 $MALLOB_OPTIONS
```

Given a machine with `$nthreads` cores (and twice the number of hardware threads), the following command spawns a single process with one solver thread per core (per hardware thread):

```
RDMAV_FORK_SAFE=1; mpirun -np 1 --bind-to core --map-by ppr:1:node:pe=$nthreads build/mallob -t=$nthreads $MALLOB_OPTIONS
RDMAV_FORK_SAFE=1; mpirun -np 1 --bind-to hwthread --map-by ppr:1:node:pe=$((2*$nthreads)) build/mallob -t=$((2*$nthreads)) $MALLOB_OPTIONS
```

Alternatively, only executing `build/mallob -t=$nthreads $MALLOB_OPTIONS` works as well in this case but does not pin threads to cores.

You can always stop Mallob via Ctrl+C (interrupt signal) or by executing `killall mpirun` (or `killall build/mallob`). 
You can also specify the number of jobs to process (with `-J=$NUM_JOBS`) and/or the time to pass (with `-T=$TIME_LIMIT_SECS`) before Mallob terminates on its own.

For exact and clean logging, you should not rely on a textfile in which you piped Mallob's output.
Instead, specify a logging directory with `-log=<log-dir>` where separate sub-directories and files will be created for each worker / thread. 
This can be combined with the `-q` option to suppress Mallob's output to STDOUT. 
Verbosity of logging can be set with the `-v` option (as long as Mallob was compiled with the respective verbosity or higher, see `-DMALLOB_LOG_VERBOSITY` above).
All further options of Mallob can be seen by executing Mallob with the `-h` option. (This also works without the `mpirun` prefix.)

For running Mallob on distributed clusters, please also consult [the scripts and documentation from our Euro-Par 2022 software artifact](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.20000642), [our more recent quickstart guide for clusters](docs/clusters.md) and/or the user documentation of your particular cluster.

## Solve a single problem

Use Mallob option `-mono=$PROBLEM_FILE` where `$PROBLEM_FILE` is the path and file name of the problem to solve (DIMACS CNF format, possibly with .xz or .lzma compression, for SAT; whitespace-separated plain text file for K-Means). Specify the application of this instance with `-mono-app=sat` or `-mono-app=kmeans`. 

In this mode, all processes participate in solving, overhead is minimal, and Mallob terminates immediately after the job has been processed.

## Solve multiple instances in an orchestrated manner

If you want to solve a fixed set of $n$ formulae or wish to evaluate Mallob's scheduling behavior with simulated jobs, follow these steps:

* Write the set of formulae into a text file `$INSTANCE_FILE` (one line per path).
* Configure the base properties of a job with a JSON file `$JOB_TEMPLATE`. For a plain job with default properties you can use `templates/job-template.json`.
* Configure the behavior of each job-introducing process ("client") with a JSON file `$CLIENT_TEMPLATE`. You can find the simplest possible configuration in `templates/client-template.json` and a more complex randomized configuration in `templates/client-template-random.json`. Both files contain all necessary documentation to adjust them as desired.

Then use these Mallob options:
```
-c=1 -ajpc=$MAX_PAR_JOBS -ljpc=$((2*$MAX_PAR_JOBS)) -J=$NUM_JOBS -job-desc-template=$INSTANCE_FILE -job-template=$JOB_TEMPLATE -client-template=$CLIENT_TEMPLATE -pls=0
```
where `$NUM_JOBS` is set to $n$ (if it is larger than $n$, a client cycles through the provided job descriptions indefinitely). You can set `-sjd=1` to shuffle the provided job descriptions. You can also increase the number of client processes introducing jobs by increasing the value of `-c`. However, note that the provided configuration for active jobs in the system is applied to each of the clients independently, hence the formulae provided in the instance file are not split up among the clients but rather duplicated.

## Process jobs on demand

This is the default and most general configuration of Mallob, i.e., without `-mono` or `-job-template` options.
You can manually set the number of worker processes (`-w`) and the number of client processes introducing jobs (`-c`). By default, all processes are workers (`-w=-1`) and a single process is additionally a client (`-c=1`). The $k$ client processes are always the $k$ processes of the highest ranks, and they open up file system interfaces for introducing jobs and retrieving results at the directories `.api/jobs.0/` through `.api/jobs.`$k-1$`/`.

### Introducing a Job

To introduce a job to the system, drop a JSON file in `.api/jobs.`$i$`/in/` (e.g., `.api/jobs.0/in/`) on the filesystem of the according PE structured like this:  
```
{
    "application": "SAT",
    "user": "admin", 
    "name": "test-job-1", 
    "files": ["/path/to/difficult/formula.cnf"], 
    "priority": 0.7, 
    "wallclock-limit": "5m", 
    "cpu-limit": "10h",
    "arrival": 10.3,
    "dependencies": ["admin.prereq-job1", "admin.prereq-job2"],
    "incremental": false
}
```    

Here is a brief overview of all required and optional fields in the JSON API:

| Field name        | Required? | Value type   | Description                                                                                                    |
| ----------------- | :-------: | -----------: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| user              | **yes**   | String       | A string specifying the user who is submitting the job                                                         |
| name              | **yes**   | String       | A user-unique name for this job (increment)                                                                    |
| files             | **yes***  | String array | File paths of the input to solve. For SAT, this must be a single (text file or compressed file or named pipe). |
| priority          | **yes***  | Float > 0    | Priority of the job (higher is more important)                                                                 |
| application       | **yes**   | String       | Which kind of problem is being solved; currently either of "SAT" or "DUMMY" (default: DUMMY)                   |
| wallclock-limit   | no        | String       | Job wallclock limit: combination of a number and a unit (ms/s/m/h/d)                                           |
| cpu-limit         | no        | String       | Job CPU time limit: combination of a number and a unit (ms/s/m/h/d)                                            |
| arrival           | no        | Float >= 0   | Job's arrival time (seconds) since program start; ignore job until then                                        |
| max-demand        | no        | Int >= 0     | Override the max. number of MPI processes this job should receive at any point in time (0: no limit)           |
| dependencies      | no        | String array | User-qualified job names (using "." as a separator) which must exit **before** this job is introduced          |
| interrupt         | no        | Bool         | If `true`, the job given by "user" and "name" is interrupted (for incremental jobs, just the current revision).|
| incremental       | no        | Bool         | Whether this job has multiple _increments_ / _revisions_ and should be treated as such                         |
| literals          | no        | Int array    | You can specify the set of SAT literals (for this increment) directly in the JSON.                             |
| precursor         | no        | String       | _(Only for incremental jobs)_ User-qualified job name (`<user>.<jobname>`) of this job's previous increment    |
| assumptions       | no        | Int array    | _(Only for incremental jobs)_ You can specify the set of assumptions for this increment directly in the JSON.  |
| done              | no        | Bool         | _(Only for incremental jobs)_ If `true`, the incremental job given by "precursor" is finalized and cleaned up. |

*) Not needed if `done` is set to `true`.

In the above example, a job is introduced with priority 0.7, with a wallclock limit of five minutes and a CPU limit of 10 CPUh.

For SAT solving, the input can be provided (a) as a plain file, (b) as a compressed (.lzma / .xz) file, or (c) as a named (UNIX) pipe.
In each case, you have the option of providing the payload (i) in text form (i.e., a valid CNF description), or, with field `content-mode: "raw"`, in binary form (i.e., a sequence of bytes representing integers).  
For text files, Mallob uses the common iCNF extension for incremental formulae: The file may contain a single line of the form `a <lit1> <lit2> ... 0` where `<lit1>`, `<lit2>` etc. are assumption literals.   
For binary files, Mallob reads clauses as integer sequences with separation zeroes in between.
Two zeroes in a row (i.e., an "empty clause") signal the end of clause literals, after which a number of assumption integers may be specified. Another zero signals that the description is complete.  
If providing a named pipe, make sure that (a) the named pipe is already created when submitting the job and (b) your application pipes the formula _after_ submitting the job (else it will hang indefinitely except if this is done in a separate thread).

Assumptions can also be specified directly in the JSON describing the job via the `assumptions` field (without any trailing zero). This way, an incremental application could maintain a single text file with a monotonically growing set of clauses.

The "arrival" and "dependencies" fields are useful to test a particular preset scenario of jobs: The "arrival" field ensures that the job will be scheduled only after Mallob ran for the specified amount of seconds. The "dependencies" field ensures that the job is scheduled only if all specified other jobs are already processed.

Mallob is notified by the kernel as soon as a valid file is placed in `.api/jobs.0/in/` and will immediately remove the file and schedule the job.

### Retrieving a Job Result

Upon completion of a job, Mallob writes a result JSON file under `.api/jobs.0/out/<user-name>.<job-name>.json` (you can repeatedly query the directory contents or employ a kernel-level mechanism like `inotify`).
Such a file may look like this:
```
{
    "application": "SAT",
    "cpu-limit": "10h",
    "file": "/path/to/difficult/formula.cnf",
    "name": "test-job-1",
    "priority": 0.7,
    "result": {
        "resultcode": 10,
        "resultstring": "SAT",
        "solution": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    },
    "stats": {
        "time": {
            "parsing": 0.03756427764892578,
            "processing": 0.07197785377502441,
            "scheduling": 0.0002980232238769531,
            "total": 0.11040472984313965
        },
        "used_cpu_seconds": 0.2633516788482666,
        "used_wallclock_seconds": 0.06638360023498535
    },
    "user": "admin",
    "wallclock-limit": "5m"
}
```
The result code is 0 is unknown, 10 if SAT (solved successfully), and 20 if UNSAT (no solution exists).
The `solution` field is application-dependent.
For SAT solving, in case of SATISFIABLE, the solution field contains the found satisfying assignment; in case of UNSAT, the result for an incremental job contains the set of failed assumptions.
Instead of the "solution" field, the response may also contain the fields "solution-size" and "solution-file" if the solution is large and if option `-pls` is set. In that case, your application has to read `solution-size` integers (as bytes) representing the solution from the named pipe located at `solution-file`.

# Debugging

Debugging of distributed applications can be difficult, especially in Mallob's case where message passing goes hand in hand with multithreading and inter-process communication. Please take a look at [docs/debugging.md](docs/debugging.md) for some notes on how Mallob runs can be diagnosed and debugged appropriately.

<hr/>

# Programming Interfaces

Mallob can be extended in the following ways:

* New options for Mallob can be added in `src/optionslist.hpp`.
    - Options which are specific to a certain application can be found and edited in `src/app/$APPKEY/options.hpp`.
* To add a new SAT solver to be used in a SAT solver engine, do the following:
    - Add a subclass of `PortfolioSolverInterface`. (You can use the existing implementation for any of the existing solvers and adapt it to your solver.)
    - Add your solver to the portfolio initialization in `src/app/sat/execution/engine.cpp`.
* To extend Mallob by adding another kind of application (like combinatorial search, planning, SMT, ...), please read [docs/application_engines.md](docs/application_engines.md).
* To add a unit test, create a class `test_*.cpp` in `src/test` and then add the test case to the bottom of `CMakeLists.txt`.
* To add a system test, consult the files `scripts/systest_commons.sh` and/or `scripts/systest.sh`.
