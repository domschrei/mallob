First and foremost, please consult Mallob's base `README.md`, which features important general documentation, e.g., how to build and run Mallob.

For additional, more specialized aspects, you can find further information in the following files:

* `application_engines.md`: How to implement your own application engine in Mallob
* `clusters.md`: How to set up Mallob on an HPC cluster (tailored towards SuperMUC-NG but partially also applicable to other systems)
* `debugging.md`: How to debug and troubleshoot Mallob
* `interpret.md`: (WIP) How to extract results and statistics on a run of Mallob
